## Carthage College Senior Thesis - "Please Don't Sing"
* For my senior thesis, I collected audio recordings from volunteers who sang "Happy Birthday". I created an R Shiny App for participants to hear randomly selected recordings and rate them on a scale of 0 - 10. Each recording was heard by many people, scores were normalized by reviewer, and recordings were given a rating based on the average of their reviewers' scoring. Then, I used this labeled data to build a model that could predict how enjoyable a given recording of "Happy Birthday" was, and presented the results on an interactive web app using Heroku.

## Assessing Air Quality and Plastic Production during the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic
* While participating in the [Correlation One "Data Science for All"](https://www.correlation-one.com/en/data-science-for-all) program, we investigated how environmental indicators (air quality and plastic production) changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## TAMU Hackathon - NLP analysis across gender using Enron Data  
* For a group project at the [2021 TAMU hackathon](https://tamuhack.org/th/2021#Home), we analyzed the Enron emails dataset to understand how professional communication and language use varies across genders.

## Data Visualization Using Tableau and ArcGIS 
* For an undergraduate class, I had to display proficiency in various Tableau skills on a dataset of my choice. I used Air Quality data to explore air quality changes over time and across US regions.

## Building R Shiny Dashboards  
* To improve my R Shiny skills, I practiced creating R Shiny dashboards with various publically-available data. See below.

### Welcome!

I am a data scientist interested in applying quantitative and technological methods to public health and public policy research. I earned my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Data Science from [Carthage College](https://www.carthage.edu/) and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computational and Data Sciences at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). My research focuses on how data science methods can uncover new findings about substance use to better protect and treat people battling substance use disorders.

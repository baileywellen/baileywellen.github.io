Hello, World! I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Data Science, and I love utilizing programming to solve hard-hitting problems in our communities. I am passionate about using Data Science for social good and ensuring that data is analyzed ethically and accurately - I am always looking to collaborate on projects where I can help further that mission.

## Carthage College Senior Thesis - "Please Don't Sing"
* For my senior thesis, I collected audio recordings from volunteers who sang "Happy Birthday". I created an R Shiny App for participants to hear randomly selected recordings and rate them on a scale of 0 - 10. Each recording was heard by many people, scores were normalized by reviewer, and recordings were given a rating based on the average of their reviewers' scoring. Then, I used this labeled data to build a model that could predict how enjoyable a given recording of "Happy Birthday" was, and presented the results on an interactive web app using Heroku.

## Data Visualization Using Tableau and ArcGIS 
* For an undergraduate class, I had to display proficiency in various Tableau skills on a dataset of my choice. I used Air Quality data to explore air quality changes over time and across US regions.

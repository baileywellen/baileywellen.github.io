### Welcome!

I am a data scientist interested in applying data science methods to addiction health services and public policy  research. I earned my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Data Science from [Carthage College](https://www.carthage.edu/) and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computational and Data Sciences at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/).  I am interested in identifying substance use disorder treatment access disparities and implementation barriers by using Electronic Health Records (EHR) and administrative datasets. Algorithmic fairness, implementation feasibility, and the relevance of my solution/findings to people with lived experience is of utmost importance to me.

### Professional Goals

I am excited to get into the workforce, and I hope I can hit the ground running! 

My professional goals can be split into the "Three I's" : Impact, Improvement, and Instruction

* Impact - I am working to develop skills to become a competent and thorough data scientist. I hope to positively impact my coworkers and clients by programming with foundational morals of accuracy, transparency, and fairness  
* Improvement - I want to be a forever learner. I plan to position myself in communities and roles where I am surrounded by people who know more than I do, so that I can be constantly growing and improving   
* Instruction - I hope to return to academia later in my career to mentor and instruct the future data-scientists/programmers/innovators of the world!

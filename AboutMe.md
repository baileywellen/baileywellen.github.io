##Professional Facts  


### Professional Goals 

I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Data Science, but my school does not have any Data Science faculty members. With the help of a very diverse team of professors, I worked to construct a self-designed Data Science major by pulling classes from the Management, Math, CS, Geographic Information Sciences, and Economics departments.

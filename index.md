Hello, World! I am a data scientist interested in applying quantitative and technological methods to public health and public policy research. I earned my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Data Science from Carthage College and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computational and Data Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. After a longtime interest in Substance Use Disorders and volunteer work at substance use treatment centers, I have decided to focus my research on how data science methods can uncover new findings about substance use to better protect and treat people battling substance use disorders.
